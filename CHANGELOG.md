## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Kotlin and Swift files are indexed by default** — `**/*.kt`, `**/*.kts` and `**/*.swift` added to the default include patterns; `.kts` is detected as Kotlin. Files of unknown language are no longer indexed (they used to get a lone `file` node).
- **Kotlin extraction** — calls, imports (incl. aliases and wildcards), properties, interfaces, enums and enum entries, packages, secondary constructors, companion objects and type aliases were missing because the extractor used node kinds / field names that don't exist in `tree-sitter-kotlin-ng`. Top-level non-`private` declarations are now emitted as implicit exports.
- **Calls, imports and declarations in other languages** that were lost to wrong node kinds / field names: Java method calls and `new Foo()`; Swift calls, structs, enums and extensions; Ruby calls and `def self.x`; C/C++ functions, methods, namespaces and macros (previously no function nodes at all); PHP member / static / nullsafe calls and `use` imports; Go imports and call names (no more garbage names from func-literal callees); Rust `use` lists, `pub use` re-exports and macro calls; C# qualified, aliased, `static` and `global` using directives and `public` visibility; Python `from x import A, B` (only `A` was kept) and plain `import x`; JS/TS arrow functions and function expressions named after their variable (calls inside them had no scope).
- **Blazor** (`.razor`) files are indexed at file level only. They were parsed with the C# grammar, which extracted nothing.
- **Cross-directory calls resolve through imports, packages and modules** — the resolver only linked calls within one file or directory, so calls into other packages (Java / Kotlin / Go / C# / PHP), modules and crates were dropped. Calls now resolve through the import binding the name (with import paths normalised per language: dotted, `::`, `\`, relative `./` / `.x` / `crate::` / `super::`, quoted includes; Export nodes followed to the declaration), through an imported qualifier (`Report.describe()`, Go `model.Describe()`), and through names in scope: wildcard imports, C/C++ includes, C# `using` namespaces, the caller's own package / namespace, Ruby `require` / `require_relative`, and Swift modules (SPM `Sources/<Target>/` of a `Package.swift`, or an Xcode project). Same-named functions in unrelated directories without an import are still never linked (#43).
- **Qualified calls no longer resolve to unrelated same-file functions** — `String.format(..)` inside `fun format` was a self-edge; qualifiers naming another type, or receivers of free functions, now rule candidates out.
- **Overloads and same-named methods** — calls with several candidates were dropped. They are narrowed by receiver (`Type.m()`, the caller's own type for unqualified / `this.m()` calls); overloads of one method all get an edge, and up to three candidates of different types get an edge each with confidence `0.3`.
- **Ruby `require` / `require_relative`** with a literal path are Import nodes instead of calls to `require`.
- Java `package` declarations, wildcard / static imports and C# file-scoped namespaces are extracted.

### Changed

- Same-file calls with a qualifier other than `this` / `self` or a type declared in the file (`obj.m()`, `util.f()`) are resolved by the resolver (confidence `0.5`) instead of directly at extraction (`1.0`), so an import binding the qualifier takes precedence.
- DB schema v5: `unresolved_refs.qualifier` stores the call's qualifier (additive migration).

### Removed

- Extraction code and grammar crates for languages that were never enabled in `is_language_supported` (Bash, Dart, Elixir, Elm, Erlang, Fortran, Groovy, Haskell, Julia, Lua, MATLAB, Nix, Perl, PowerShell, R, Scala, Zig, TOML, YAML) and the unused `tree-sitter-blazor` dependency of `coraline`. Supported language count in the docs corrected from 33 to 17.

### Testing

- Grammar guard test: every node kind and field name in the extraction tables must exist in the language's tree-sitter grammar.
- Per-language extraction tests (`tests/<lang>_extraction_test.rs`) and end-to-end edge fixture tests (`tests/edge_fixture_test.rs`) asserting stored `calls` / `imports` edges and `coraline_callers` / `coraline_callees` results for Kotlin, Java, Swift, Go, Python, TypeScript, C#, Rust, C/C++, Ruby and PHP.
- Resolver tests (`tests/resolver_test.rs`): cross-dir resolution per language, plus regression tests mirroring #43 (same-named functions in unrelated directories / packages / Swift projects without an import stay unlinked).

## [0.13.1] - 2026-09-08

Patch release. Re-issue of `0.13.0` plus six bug-fix commits
that landed on the `feat/phase5-substrate` branch between
`0.13.0` and the merge of PR #91. See the v0.13.0 entry below
for the feature additions in this release.

### Fixed

- **Additive migrations now run on every connection open**
  (`fix(db): run additive migrations on every db::open_database`).
  Previously, only `coraline init` invoked
  `apply_incremental_migrations` — projects upgraded across
  a schema-version boundary (e.g. v0.12.0 → v0.13.0) wouldn't
  pick up the new `edges.confidence` / `nodes.cluster_id` /
  `edges.process_id` columns until they re-ran `coraline init`,
  leaving `coraline sync` failing with `no such column: cluster_id`
  halfway through the post-extraction passes.
- **Extraction honors `pub` / `pub(crate)` / `pub(super)`**
  (`fix(extraction): read declaration visibility from tree-sitter
AST`). Every Node-construction site in `extraction.rs` was
  hardcoding `is_exported = false`; only `Export`-kind nodes got
  `is_exported = true`. Process-tracing entry-point discovery
  (Phase 5.1) filters on `is_exported = 1`, so before this fix
  every real `pub fn` was filtered out and
  `coraline_process_for` returned empty for every project.
- **Embed works on a project whose v1 `vectors` BLOB table has
  already been migrated**
  (`fix(vec-ext): lazy vec0 schema setup + process-wide
auto-extension register`). Two changes: (a) a
  `runtime::register_global_init()` called from `main()` so the
  sqlite-vec auto-extension is registered before any
  `Connection::open` (so vec0 is available to every subsequent
  db connection), and (b) an idempotent `ensure_vec0_schema(conn)`
  that creates `vectors_vec` + `vectors_meta` and migrates any
  existing v1 rows on first call. Both `coraline embed` paths
  were failing end-to-end with `no such module: vec0` /
  `no such table: vectors_meta` before this change.
- **`cargo-fuzz` build under `default-features = false`**
  (`fix(ci): unblock cargo-fuzz build under default-features=false`).
  The `pub mod vectors;` module in `lib.rs` is gated behind the
  `embeddings` / `embeddings-dynamic` features, but `f64_to_f32_lossy`
  (an IEEE 754 f64→f32 helper) didn't actually need either feature
  — moved to `crate::utils` (always compiled) so fuzz targets and
  any other default-features=false build path can resolve it.
  Also backticked `clippy::cast_possible_truncation` in the
  docstring and reordered one import alphabetically for the Format
  check.
- **`clippy::expect_used` and `clippy::too_long_first_doc_paragraph`
  pass for the new vec-ext helpers**
  (`chore: pass clippy::too_long_first_doc_paragraph +
clippy::expect_used`). `main()` now surfaces
  `register_global_init` errors to stderr and exits 2, rather
  than calling `.expect(...)` on a `Result`. Docstrings on
  `ensure_vec0_schema` and `register_global_init` were re-shaped
  to fit the 25-word opening-paragraph lint.
- **`db::clear_database` is feature-aware**
  (`fix(db): make clear_database feature-aware (vec-ext vs BLOB
storage)`). On a project whose embedding table is the v0
  `vectors_vec` virtual table, `coraline index -f` now drops
  `vectors_meta` + `vectors_vec` instead of the non-existent
  `vectors`. Wrapped in a single `execute_batch` so partial
  failure still rolls back atomically.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- **5.1 Clustering + process tracing** — Louvain community detection over the call graph writes `nodes.cluster_id` per indexed node. A forward DFS from exported entry points (functions / methods with no incoming `calls` edge) writes `edges.process_id` for every edge that participates in a traced process, with cycle protection and a depth cap. Three new MCP tools expose the result:
  - `coraline_cluster_overview` — list of Louvain clusters with a representative node per cluster.
  - `coraline_cluster_members` — list all nodes sharing a `cluster_id`.
  - `coraline_process_for` — given a node id, return the full execution-flow trace (entry point + nodes + edges).
    Both columns are nullable; `cluster_id IS NULL` and `process_id IS NULL` mean "not clustered" / "not in any traced process" respectively. Runs as post-extraction passes 6 (Cluster) and 7 (Trace processes) of every `coraline index` / `coraline sync`.
- **5.2 Edge confidence scoring** — every `Edge` carries `confidence: f32` in `[0.0, 1.0]`: `1.0` direct AST-extracted, `0.95` strongly-typed Rust path (`crate::` / `super::` / `self::`), `0.5` generic name match / framework fallback / heuristic ranker. `coraline_callers`, `coraline_callees`, and `coraline_find_references` accept a `min_confidence` parameter (default `0.0` includes every edge; `0.8` is a typical working value to suppress generic matches). Schema migration v2 — additive, idempotent on existing DBs.
- **5.3 sqlite-vec integration** — optional `sqlite-vec = 0.1.9` backend behind the new `vec-ext` Cargo feature. Auto-extension registration via `sqlite3_auto_extension` makes the `vec0` virtual table available on every connection. Migration from the v1 BLOB column to the `vec0` table is in-place; existing DBs remain readable through the legacy path. The `doctor` probe set and `coraline_status?include_doctor=true` report the `vec_ext` state.
- **5.4 Doctor probe wired into `coraline_status`** — new `include_doctor` (default `false`) and `deep` (default `false`) parameters on the MCP `coraline_status` tool. With `include_doctor: true`, the response carries the full `coraline doctor --json` payload under `doctor_report` plus a top-level bool `doctor_needs_attention` derived from `exit_code == 0`, so self-healing UIs can gate a single boolean and walk `probes[].fix` for one actionable remediation hint per failing check. Back-compat: with `include_doctor` omitted, the response shape is identical to the prior version. Two new unit tests pin the contract: `status_without_include_doctor_matches_legacy_shape` and `status_with_include_doctor_returns_full_report_and_needs_attention_flag`.
- **Three new MCP tools** — `coraline_cluster_overview`, `coraline_cluster_members`, `coraline_process_for` (see 5.1). Tool count 35 → 38.

### Schema migrations

- v2 — `edges.confidence REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 1.0`.
- v3 — `nodes.cluster_id INTEGER`, `edges.process_id INTEGER`.

Both are additive and idempotent: `db::apply_incremental_migrations` gates on `PRAGMA table_info(<table>)` and writes a row to `schema_versions`. Existing DBs migrate in place on next `coraline init` / `coraline sync` without backfill.

### Documentation

- `docs/MCP_TOOLS.md` / `book/src/mcp-tools.md` — `include_doctor` + `deep` on `coraline_status`, `doctor_report` / `doctor_needs_attention` output, `min_confidence` on `coraline_callers` / `coraline_callees` / `coraline_find_references`, three new cluster/process tools, tool count 35 → 38.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` / `book/src/architecture.md` — `nodes.cluster_id` and `edges.confidence` / `edges.process_id` added to Node/Edge struct definitions; Edge confidence scale table; indexing pipeline expanded with Phase 5.1 steps 6 (Cluster) and 7 (Trace processes); schema table now includes `vectors` + `schema_versions`; additive-migrations section (v2, v3); source-layout block refreshed with the new modules (`clustering.rs`, `vec_ext.rs`, `doctor.rs`, `security.rs`, `audit.rs`, `update.rs`, `db/`); tool descriptor count 20 → 38.
- `docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md` / `book/src/cli-reference.md` — cross-link `coraline_status` ↔ `coraline doctor` and document the shared `doctor_report` JSON shape.
- `docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` — new Phase 5 section.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **`coraline doctor`** — new diagnostic subcommand that checks config presence, database health, git hook installation, and embedding-model state, printing a `✔`/`✘` report with a remediation hint per failing check. `--quick` skips the three slow model-load/inference/embed-coverage probes (deep mode is the default); `--json` emits a machine-readable report for CI gating. Exits `0` only if every check passed.
- **`coraline init --embed` / `--no-embed` / `--yes`** — explicit, non-interactive control over the post-init embedding-model download decision, replacing the TTY-only prompt as the sole path. `--no-embed` always wins over `--yes`; the interactive prompt remains the fallback when no flag is given and stdin is a TTY.
- **`coraline status` embedding-model line** — status output now shows the model file (name + size) or a "not present" hint, plus the resolved model name and directory, so `coraline_semantic_search` readiness is visible without running `doctor`.
- **Multi-model embedding support** — `vectors.model` in `config.toml` (previously present but unused) now actually selects which embedding model Coraline downloads, loads, and stores against. Ships with `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` (general-purpose, default) and `jina-embeddings-v2-base-code` (code-specialised, opt-in), both 768-dim. New `coraline model list` shows the registry; `coraline model download`/`status` accept `--model <name>` to target a non-default model (defaulting to `vectors.model` from config). Switching models on a project with existing embeddings requires re-running `coraline embed` — every read path (`coraline_semantic_search`, `doctor`'s coverage probe, staleness checks) filters by the `model` column already present in the `vectors` table schema, so a switch is self-healing rather than mixing scores across models.
- **Structured `EMBEDDING_MODEL_MISSING` MCP error** — `coraline_semantic_search` failures from a missing/unloadable model now return a typed error envelope (`code`, `message`, `recover: { command, docs }`) in `structuredContent` instead of only free-form text, so an MCP agent can branch on `code` and act on `recover.command` directly.

### Fixed

- **Restored `coraline_audit_docs`, `coraline_find_file` (MCP), and `coraline audit-docs` (CLI)** — a prior refactor (`b079ac5`, config.toml consolidation) silently dropped the `tools::audit_tools` module declaration, the `FindFileTool` registration, and the `audit-docs` CLI subcommand, while leaving the fully-implemented code and its documentation in place. All three are wired back in; `docs/MCP_TOOLS.md` now lists all 35 actually-registered MCP tools (up from an undercounted 29), including the batch (`coraline_batch_*`) and advanced-search (`coraline_search_by_*`, `coraline_find_by_kind_in_file`) tool groups that were implemented but never documented. The `coraline_session_security_status` pseudo-tool, documented but removed in the same refactor (its `SessionSecurityState` tracking no longer exists on `McpServer`), and the "Background Auto-Sync" background thread, documented but never present in the current dual-era `McpServer`, are removed from the docs rather than restored — both are real feature gaps tracked separately, not doc errors.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **Shared global config and ONNX model directory** (#78) — `~/.config/coraline/config.toml` and `~/.config/coraline/models/<model>/` are now the default locations, with the per-project `.coraline/` paths kept as a one-time migration source via `coraline model migrate`. Per-field merge: a local `[vectors]` section that only sets `enabled = true` still inherits `model_dir` from the global config. Generated embeddings and `.coraline/coraline.db` remain project-local — the share is the model weights file, not the vectors.
- **Dual-era MCP server** (#56) — `McpServer` now serves both the upcoming-draft MCP spec (header-style `_meta` handshake) and the legacy handshake-based protocol (`2025-11-25` and earlier, including the `2025-06-18` revision this codebase originally targeted). Era is detected from the incoming `initialize` request shape, not from a pinned protocol version, so the same binary negotiates with both classes of client. `mcp/mod.rs` and `mcp/protocol.rs` split out the era dispatch from the JSON-RPC plumbing; `mcp_request` fuzz harness drives dispatch through arbitrary bytes.
- **`.github/workflows/security-pr-base.yml`** — `pull_request_target` worker that audits the BASE branch via `cargo deny check` on every PR, satisfying the required `Check licenses and bans` status check on PRs that don't modify any dependency manifest. Explicitly checks out `${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}` and never touches fork code.

### Fixed

- **MCP server no longer creates `.coraline/` before a project is initialized** (#71) — `McpServer` previously materialised the project directory as a side-effect of starting up, which broke tooling that distinguished "indexed" from "uninitialised" by directory presence. Initialisation now happens only on an explicit `coraline init` or on the first indexing call.
- **`tree-sitter-markdown` upstream fork swap** (#80) — `tree-sitter-markdown-fork` → `tree-sitter-markdown-updated` to pick up maintenance fixes and avoid the unmaintained crate surfacing as a `cargo audit` warning.

### Changed

- **CI action pins** — folded in 5 open dependabot version PRs:
  - `actions/checkout` 6.0.3 → 7.0.1 (#76)
  - `actions/cache` 5.0.5 → 6.1.0 (#74; cherry-picked as 7f0b700)
  - `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` 4.36.2 → 4.37.3 (#75)
  - `ossf/scorecard-action` 2.4.3 → 2.4.4 (#77)
  - `softprops/action-gh-release` 3.0.0 → 3.0.2 (#73)
    All SHA-pinned substitutions (sed-equivalent). Where this branch was on
    a pre-bump base (e.g. v6.0.3 checkout, v3.0.0 action-gh-release, v4
    in book.yml), the intermediate dependabot step is skipped to land
    on the dependabot target version directly.
- **Cargo dependency** — `tree-sitter-erlang` 0.18.0 → 0.20.0 (#79),
  skipping 0.19.0 since the branch's base predates that release.

### Internal

- **Fuzzing harness and CI jobs** — new `fuzz/` workspace member with two `cargo-fuzz` targets: `mcp_request` (drives `McpServer::handle_message` with arbitrary bytes through JSON-RPC deserialization and dispatch) and `db_search` (drives `db::search_nodes` / `find_nodes_by_name` / `find_exports_by_module` against an in-memory SQLite DB initialised with the production schema, exercising `build_fts_query` + FTS5 MATCH parsing). `McpServer::handle_message` is now `pub` so external harnesses can drive dispatch without going through stdin.
- **`.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`** — nightly `cargo fuzz run` for each target with a configurable per-target time budget (default 300s; overridable via `workflow_dispatch` input). Uploads the corpus as a workflow artifact on success.
- **`.github/workflows/cifuzz.yml`** + **`.clusterfuzzlite/`** — per-PR ClusterFuzzLite run with libFuzzer + AddressSanitizer on the upstream `base-builder-rust` image. Satisfies the OpenSSF Scorecard Fuzzing check (the cargo-fuzz language probe does not currently recognise Rust, but ClusterFuzzLite is detected).
- **Pinned all unpinned GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/`** — resolved 9 OSSF Scorecard `Pinned-Dependencies` alerts. `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` (5 occurrences in `ci.yml`) now points at `@29eef336d9b2848a0b548edc03f92a220660cdb8` (the same SHA already used in `release.yml` / `docs-pages.yml` / `security.yml`, so the toolchain is reproducible across the workspace). The 4 actions in `book.yml` are also SHA-pinned: `actions/checkout@34e114876b0b11c390a56381ad16ebd13914f8d5`, `peaceiris/actions-mdbook@ee69d230fe19748b7abf22df32acaa93833fad08` (dereferenced from the v2 annotated tag, since `peaceiris` uses annotated tags), `actions/upload-pages-artifact@56afc609e74202658d3ffba0e8f6dda462b719fa`, and `actions/deploy-pages@d6db90164ac5ed86f2b6aed7e0febac5b3c0c03e`.
- **Scoped workflow permissions to least privilege** — resolved 2 OSSF Scorecard `Token-Permissions` alerts (`score is 0: topLevel 'contents' permission set to 'write'`). `auto-tag.yml` and `dependabot-automerge.yml` now declare `contents: read` / `pull-requests: read` at workflow-level and only escalate to `write` on the specific job that needs it (the `tag` push for auto-tag, the `auto-merge` for dependabot-automerge). The remaining `score is 0: jobLevel 'contents' permission set to 'write'` alert on `release.yml`'s `github-release` job is necessary — `softprops/action-gh-release` (and every alternative — `gh release create`, `ncipollo/release-action`) requires `contents: write` to create the release, and the job's other permissions (`attestations: write`, `id-token: write`) are required by `actions/attest-build-provenance` for SLSA provenance signing.
- **Disabled `persist-credentials` on the auto-tag checkout** — mitigates the remaining `Dangerous-Workflow` Scorecard alert by preventing the `GITHUB_TOKEN` from being persisted as a git credential when checking out `${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}`. `cargo metadata --no-deps` (the only thing the workflow runs on the checked-out commit) doesn't execute `build.rs`, but a future change that did execute the checkout would no longer inherit the token. The alert itself can't be closed while the workflow still uses `workflow_run` + `head_sha` (needed to wait for CI green before tagging); it's gated by `head_branch == 'main'` and `conclusion == 'success'` so the upstream is always a trusted push to `main`.
- **ClusterFuzzLite workflow repaired** — the `Build fuzzers` check had been failing on every push since the workflow was introduced in 49d3e67. Four layered fixes: (a) `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=nightly` is now set in `.clusterfuzzlite/Dockerfile` because libsqlite3-sys 0.38's `build.rs` uses `cfg_select!` (rust-lang/rust#115585), which is unstable in build scripts on stable Rust; (b) `.clusterfuzzlite/build.sh` is symlinked to `$SRC/build.sh` so ClusterFuzzLite's compile entrypoint can find it; (c) `build.sh` searches the cargo workspace target dir layout (`target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/`) in addition to the cargo-fuzz default (`fuzz/target/...`), because the `fuzz` crate is a workspace member and inherits the workspace target dir; (d) the `build` and `run` jobs were combined into a single `cifuzz` job so the OUT Docker volume survives on ephemeral GitHub-hosted runners (the volume was gone between jobs, producing `Out directory: /github/workspace/build-out does not exist.` at run time).
- **`enforce_admins` enabled on `main` branch protection** — admins can no longer bypass the required status checks (`test`, `clippy`, `fmt`, `deny`, `coverage`) or 1 approving review. Resolves OSPS-AC-03.01.
- **`fuzz_seconds` workflow_dispatch input validated** — `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml` now rejects non-integer or out-of-range values before interpolating into the `cargo fuzz` shell command (`[[ "$FUZZ_TIME" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] && [ "$FUZZ_TIME" -le 3600 ]`). Resolves OSPS-BR-01.01.
- **GitHub secret scanning + push protection enabled** — `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` scans every push and PR with `gitleaks/gitleaks-action` pinned to commit `f65dee2ef48e96e7a5a2b775b131c3d81b2e73ea` (v2.0.8). GitHub native secret scanning and push protection are enabled at the repo level via the `security_and_analysis` API. Resolves OSPS-BR-07.01.
- **License bundled in release archives** — `.github/workflows/release.yml` now copies `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE` into the release directory and includes them in both the Unix `tar.gz` archive and the Windows `zip` archive alongside the `coraline` binary. Resolves OSPS-LE-03.02.
- **Manifest SPDX expression updated to `MIT OR Apache-2.0`** — `Cargo.toml`, `crates/coraline/Cargo.toml`, `crates/tree-sitter-blazor/Cargo.toml`, and `fuzz/Cargo.toml` all previously declared `license = "MIT"`, which understated the dual-license intent (both `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE` exist at the repo root).
- **License files moved into `LICENSE/` directory** — `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE` now live under `LICENSE/` at the repo root (so the source-code license is maintained in a `LICENSE/` directory, as the OSPS-LE-03.01 requirement literally specifies). The README license badge target and the `release.yml` archive steps were updated to point at the new paths; release.yml's relative-path arithmetic for the license copies was also corrected (the previous `cp ../../../../LICENSE-MIT` walked one directory above the repo root).
- **OpenSSF Baseline badge added to README** — surfaces the bestpractices.dev baseline status next to the existing license and Rust-version badges.
- **`./LICENSE.md` pointer file added** — a top-level `LICENSE.md` now sits alongside `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE` at the repo root and links to both, so the source-code license is discoverable as a single `LICENSE`-named file at the repo root (matching OSPS-LE-03.01's "LICENSE file" reading) without conflicting with the actual license files at the same level.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **`coraline sync` and `coraline index` now drive an `indicatif` braille spinner from the existing `IndexProgress` callback** — the line updates in place (`⠹ Parsing 42/100 src/foo.rs`), giving continuous visual feedback during long parses and resolving phases instead of leaving the terminal looking frozen between file updates. Bar length grows automatically when transitioning between phases (e.g. `Scanning` → `Parsing` → `Resolving`).
- **`coraline embed` now shows a per-node spinner with the current symbol name** — replaces the previous batched `\r  {i}/{total}` counter that updated only every `batch_size` nodes; users now see `(Function) load_embedding_model` advance one node at a time, making it obvious that work is happening on large projects.
- **`coraline embed` shows an indeterminate spinner during ONNX model load** — the multi-second tokenizer/session initialization no longer looks hung; spinner disappears once the model is ready and the per-node counter begins.

### Fixed

- **Release workflow `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` cross-compile regression** — `cargo install cross --git https://github.com/cross-rs/cross` (no tag) was tracking cross-rs main HEAD, which has been moving fast. The last commit that produced a green aarch64-musl build (v0.9.0, 2026-04-26) was `cross-rs/cross@65fe72b0`. Two commits later, PR #1778 ("suggest running cargo directly for native targets") started emitting a new warning inside `cross::setup()`. Combined with `cross::shell::should_fail()` (which makes warnings fatal in CI), that turned a previously recoverable setup hiccup into the opaque `Errors encountered before cross compilation, aborting.` Pinned the install to the `v0.2.5` tag with `--locked` so future cross-rs churn can't silently break the release again, and added `CROSS_DEBUG=1` so any future failure prints the underlying `cargo metadata` stderr.

### Internal

- Extracted `load_embedding_model` and `embed_nodes` helpers from `run_embed` to satisfy the `clippy::too_many_lines` lint cap.
- Removed the dead `print_progress` and `clear_progress_line` helpers from `bin/coraline.rs` (their job is now done by the spinner bar).

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **Cross-compile release builds for Linux musl/gnu** — `vectors::download_to_file` and `vectors::download_model` are now compiled under both the `embeddings` and `embeddings-dynamic` features. The previous gating (`#[cfg(feature = "embeddings")]`) caused `E0425: cannot find function download_model` when building with `--no-default-features --features embeddings-dynamic`, which is the configuration used by the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, and `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` release artifacts.

### Changed

- **MSRV bumped from 1.93 to 1.96.0** — Required by transitive dependencies (e.g. `libsqlite3-sys 0.38.1` uses the now-stabilized `cfg_select!` macro).
- **CI Clippy job inlined** — The `cargo lint` call was depending on the `.cargo/config.toml` `lint` alias, which is gitignored and therefore not visible to CI. The workflow now runs the full clippy invocation directly.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **Batch query tools (60-90% token savings)** — New MCP tools eliminate round-trip overhead for multiple lookups:
  - `coraline_batch_get_nodes` — Fetch multiple node details in one call (20 lookups: 1000 tokens → 100 tokens)
  - `coraline_batch_callers` — Get callers for multiple symbols simultaneously
  - `coraline_batch_callees` — Get callees for multiple symbols simultaneously
- **Advanced search tools (60% token savings)** — Specialized search tools reduce iterative lookups:
  - `coraline_search_by_signature` — Find symbols by type signature patterns
  - `coraline_search_by_docstring` — Search within docstring/comment content
  - `coraline_search_exported_symbols` — Filter search to public API only
  - `coraline_find_by_kind_in_file` — Get all symbols of a specific kind in a file
- **Compact JSON output format (25-65% token savings)** — All graph query tools now support `output_format` parameter:
  - `full` — Verbose JSON with descriptive keys (default for compatibility)
  - `compact` — Short keys, enums as integers, null fields omitted (350 chars → 120 chars per node)
- **Timeout configuration for OpenCode compatibility** — MCP server now supports configurable timeouts:
  - Default: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
  - CLI flag: `coraline serve --mcp --timeout 300000` (5 minutes)
  - Per-tool timeout hints in metadata (ImpactTool: 5min, BuildContextTool: 3min, SyncTool: 10min)
  - OpenCode compatible (300s default, 600s max)
- **Comprehensive mdbook documentation** — New 14-page documentation site with GitHub Pages deployment:
  - Getting Started guide (installation, quick start)
  - MCP integration for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and OpenCode
  - OpenCode setup guide with timeout configuration and troubleshooting
  - CLI reference with all commands and examples
  - Configuration reference with all TOML settings
  - Language support matrix
  - MCP tools reference (33 tools documented)
  - Architecture overview
  - Performance optimization guide
  - Advanced usage and development docs

### Changed

- **MCP protocol version updated** — Upgraded from `2024-11-05` to `2025-06-18` (latest enterprise features)
- **Configuration consolidation** — Coraline now uses only `config.toml` for all configuration. The legacy `config.json` file has been removed from new projects. Existing projects with `config.json` will be automatically migrated to `config.toml` (with backup) when running index/sync commands, or manually via `coraline config --migrate`.
- **README simplified** — Reduced from 540 lines to 133 lines (75% reduction). Essential information retained, detailed docs moved to mdbook.
- **Tool count increased** — 33 total MCP tools (from 26):
  - 19 graph query tools (includes 7 new tools: 3 batch + 4 advanced search)
  - 7 file/config tools
  - 1 context builder
  - 5 memory management tools
  - 1 documentation audit tool (optional: +1 semantic search when embeddings enabled)
- **Git hooks enhanced** — Pre-commit, pre-push, and commit-msg hooks adapted with Coraline-specific checks:
  - Pre-commit: cargo fmt, gitleaks (secret detection), cargo audit, cargo deny
  - Pre-push: tests, clippy, release build, docs, mdbook build
  - Commit-msg: conventional commit format validation
  - Installation script: `./scripts/install-hooks.sh`

### Breaking Changes

- **`config.json` no longer created** — `coraline init` now creates only `config.toml`. Existing projects are not affected (automatic migration preserves all settings).

### Performance

- **Token efficiency improvements** — Combined optimizations yield 60-95% token savings:
  - Batch queries: 90% reduction (20 calls → 1 call)
  - Compact output: 65% reduction per node (350 → 120 chars)
  - Advanced search: 60% reduction (eliminates follow-up queries)
  - Total impact: Projects using batch+compact can reduce typical graph exploration from 5000 tokens to 250 tokens

### Developer Experience

- **Strict clippy enforcement** — Comprehensive linting with all groups enabled (all, pedantic, nursery, cargo, perf)
- **Project memory system** — Four detailed memory files for persistent development context:
  - `project_overview.md` — Architecture, components, technologies, entry points
  - `style_conventions.md` — Coding standards, clippy config, best practices
  - `completion_checklist.md` — Feature completion requirements
  - `suggested_commands.md` — Development workflow commands
- **GitHub Actions workflow** — Automated mdbook deployment to GitHub Pages

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **MCP production security hardening** — new `security.rs` module with input/output guardrails, pattern-based redaction, prompt-injection detection, and configurable enforcement modes (`Off` / `Monitor` / `Enforce`).
- **`SecurityConfig`** in `CoralineConfig` — controls session limits (`max_tool_calls_per_session`, `max_guardrail_hits_per_session`, `max_blocked_calls_per_session`), read→write flow policy (`enforce_flow_policy`), output character cap (`max_output_chars`), and per-category redaction/pattern lists; surfaced in the default TOML template.
- **Per-tool risk classification** — `classify_tool_risk()` labels every registered tool as `ReadOnly` or `WriteLike`; used by the flow policy to detect anomalous read→write transitions within a session.
- **Session security state tracking** — `McpServer` maintains live counters for tool calls, guardrail hits, blocked calls, and read→write events; resets on `initialize`.
- **`coraline_session_security_status` pseudo-tool** — returns a JSON snapshot of the current session counters against configured limits; useful for monitoring and debugging from the AI client.
- **Serve-time security warning** — `coraline serve --mcp` now emits a warning when the security module is disabled; `--require-security` flag exits with code 2 when security is not enabled, allowing hardened deployments to fail fast.
- **Structured audit log events** — every tool dispatch emits a `tracing` event with `event`, `tool`, `decision`, `guardrail_hits`, `arg_hash` (SHA-256), and `result_size` for SIEM/log-pipeline integration.
- **`docs/MCP_PRODUCTION_SECURITY_PLAN.md`** — full production security checklist and code-level integration map.
- **`docs/MCP_TOOLS.md` updated** — tool count raised to 29; `coraline_session_security_status` documented with full request/response example.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **Markdown docs were silently excluded from indexing despite include globs** — added `Language::Markdown` to `is_language_supported`, allowing `**/*.md` include patterns to actually parse/index docs and enabling `coraline_audit_docs` to produce real documentation findings.

## [0.8.7] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **`coraline audit-docs --json` now respects filtering flags** — JSON output now honors `--no-stale` and `--no-undocumented` instead of always emitting both result arrays.
- **Canonical `NodeKind` serialization in doc audit output** — undocumented export `kind` values are now serialized from the enum representation (snake_case) instead of debug-lowercase formatting, preventing mismatches like `typealias` vs `type_alias`.
- **Audit docs JSON schema naming alignment** — `docs/MCP_TOOLS.md` examples now use `stale_refs_count` and `undocumented_exports_count`, matching the actual MCP response keys.

### Documentation

- Clarified README MCP tool-count wording: **27 standard tools** plus optional `coraline_semantic_search` when embeddings are available (**28 total** in that configuration).

## [0.8.6] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- **Callees/callers query accuracy:** `coraline_callees` and `coraline_callers` MCP tools now validate call edges against import/crate boundaries before returning results, eliminating false-positive cross-crate links from name collisions (e.g., `heartbeat()` in raccoon-agent falsely calling `post()` in raccoon-frontend). Validation checks: same-file, same-directory, or explicit import statements; queries fetch 2x limit to maintain result count after filtering.
- **CLI callees/callers filtering:** `coraline callees` and `coraline callers` CLI commands now apply the same boundary validation and show "No callees/callers found" when all edges are filtered out.

### Added

- **`is_valid_call_edge()` database function** — validates whether a call edge respects module/crate boundaries before inclusion in query results.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-04-21

### Dependencies

- Bump `indicatif` 0.17 → 0.18
- Bump `tree-sitter-scala` 0.25.0 → 0.26.0

### CI

- Bump `actions/upload-artifact` 7.0.0 → 7.0.1
- Bump `github/codeql-action` 4.35.1 → 4.35.2
- Bump `actions/deploy-pages` 4.0.5 → 5.0.0
- Bump `dependabot/fetch-metadata` 2.3.0 → 3.1.0

## [0.8.4] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Call graph precision:** `coraline_callees` no longer returns false-positive cross-project edges when multiple paths have the same symbol name. Resolver now prefers extractor-provided candidate IDs (better locality signal) and avoids low-confidence global-name fallback for call edges.
- Graph queries (`coraline_callees`, `coraline_callers`) now return deterministic, stable result sets via explicit `ORDER BY (line, col, target/source)` in edge retrieval, improving user trust in output consistency across repeated queries.
- **Windows test portability:** graph precision acceptance tests now normalize path separators in assertions, preventing `src\\api.rs` vs `src/api.rs` mismatches on `windows-latest`.

### Added

- **Graph precision acceptance tests** for call-edge disambiguation in mixed active/legacy workspaces, stale-file deletion edge hygiene, and fallback prevention scenarios.

### CI

- Replaced hardcoded Rust toolchain commit hashes with `@stable` tag to fix transient CI failures and ensure stable Rust channel alignment with MSRV policy.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- `coraline index`, `coraline sync`, and `coraline embed` now use a Braille spinner with the current phase/file instead of a progress bar, reducing terminal jitter during indexing and embedding
- `coraline embed` now displays an explicit model-loading status indicator while ONNX Runtime and tokenizer initialization are in progress

### Fixed

- Fixed storing-phase progress accounting in `index_all` where mixed totals (`parsed.len()` vs `files.len()`) caused visible progress jumps
- `coraline embed` now handles ONNX Runtime initialization panics gracefully and returns actionable loader error guidance instead of a panic backtrace

### CI

- Release workflow now supports auto-tag-triggered releases via `workflow_run` and shared tag/SHA resolution, avoiding the `GITHUB_TOKEN` tag-push trigger gap

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- `coraline index`, `coraline sync`, and `coraline embed` now display an `indicatif` progress bar (`{spinner} {phase} [{bar}] {pos}/{len}`) instead of raw ANSI escape sequences; `--quiet` suppresses it entirely

### Fixed

- **macOS `tree-sitter-blazor` archive warning removed** — the build now avoids the unsupported BSD `ar -D` flag probe that previously emitted noisy warnings during local builds on macOS

### CI

- Add Dependabot auto-merge workflow — approved Dependabot PRs with passing CI now merge automatically

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-15

### CI

- Bump `actions/attest-build-provenance` from 3.0.0 to 4.1.0
- Bump `actions/cache` from 5.0.4 to 5.0.5
- Bump `actions/configure-pages` from 5.0.0 to 6.0.0
- Bump `softprops/action-gh-release` from 2.6.1 to 3.0.0
- Bump `actions/upload-pages-artifact` from 3.0.1 to 5.0.0
- Pin `ort` to `=2.0.0-rc.11` in Dependabot ignore rules pending resolution of VitisAI build regression in rc.12

### Security

- **Updated `ureq` to 3.3.0, `rustls` to 0.23.38, `rustls-webpki` to 0.103.12** — resolves RUSTSEC-2026-0098 and RUSTSEC-2026-0099 (URI name constraint validation bugs)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Symbol name disambiguation for MCP graph tools** — `coraline_callers`, `coraline_callees`, `coraline_impact`, `coraline_find_references`, `coraline_node`, `coraline_dependencies`, `coraline_dependents`, and `coraline_path` now accept `name` (+ optional `file`) as an alternative to `node_id`, with clear disambiguation errors when multiple symbols share the same name
- **`file` filter on search tools** — `coraline_search` and `coraline_find_symbol` accept an optional `file` parameter to scope results to a specific file path
- **`coraline_find_file` MCP tool** — glob-based file search (`*.rs`, `test_*`, `[Cc]argo.toml`) that walks the project tree, skipping common build/hidden directories

### Fixed

- **FTS5 search hardened against special-character queries** — search terms are now individually double-quoted before SQLite `MATCH` execution, with embedded quotes escaped; blank/whitespace-only input returns empty results instead of an FTS syntax error. Queries containing `/` (e.g. file paths), `"`, or other FTS special characters now work correctly
- **MCP tool dispatch resolves prefixed tool names** — `ToolRegistry` now normalizes common client prefixes (`mcp_coraline_coraline_*`, `mcp_coraline_*`, `mcp_*`) before lookup, preventing `Unknown tool` errors when MCP clients such as VS Code Copilot automatically prefix registered tool names
- **Removed `#[allow(clippy::cast_possible_truncation)]` suppressions** — all `u64 as usize` casts in MCP tool `execute` functions replaced with `usize::try_from().ok().unwrap_or(N)`; `f64 as f32` in `SemanticSearchTool` narrowed to a single line-level allow with justification comment
- **Fixed silent empty-string return in `resolve_node_id`** — the `len() == 1` branch now returns a proper `internal_error` instead of silently producing an empty node ID if the iterator is unexpectedly exhausted
- **Release workflow not triggered by auto-tag** — tags pushed by `github-actions[bot]` via `GITHUB_TOKEN` don't fire `push` events on other workflows; auto-tag now explicitly triggers the release workflow via `workflow_dispatch`

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **MCP background auto-sync** — the MCP server now spawns a background thread that periodically checks index freshness and performs incremental sync when files have changed, keeping the knowledge graph current without manual intervention
- **Automatic incremental embedding** — after each background sync, newly-added nodes are automatically embedded when the `embeddings` feature is enabled and ONNX model files are present on disk
- **`auto_sync_interval_secs` config** — new `[sync]` setting in `config.toml` controls the background check interval (default: 120 seconds, set to 0 to disable)
- **`coraline update` CLI command** — checks crates.io for newer published versions and prints upgrade instructions
- **`get_unembedded_nodes` database query** — efficient LEFT JOIN query to find nodes missing vector embeddings, enabling incremental embedding instead of re-embedding everything
- **Repository logo asset** — added `assets/img/coraline_logo.png` and wired it into the README header for consistent project branding

### Changed

- **`ureq` is now a non-optional dependency** — always available for update checking (previously gated behind the `embeddings` feature)
- **`tree-sitter-dart` updated to 0.1.0** — migrated from deprecated `language()` function to the new `LANGUAGE` constant API

### Dependencies

- Consolidated Dependabot PRs (#15–#19) — CI action versions (`actions/checkout@v6`, `codeql-action@v4`, `upload-artifact@v7`, `download-artifact@v8.0.1`) were already at target versions; no changes needed
- Skipped `ort` 2.0.0-rc.12 due to upstream `VitisAI` build regression — remains pinned at `=2.0.0-rc.11`

### Documentation

- **README cleanup and docs-site routing** — removed emoji-heavy formatting, normalized the logo image tag, and updated primary documentation links to point to the published site at `https://greysquirr3l.github.io/coraline/`
- **Configuration, MCP, and CLI docs updated** — documented `auto_sync_interval_secs`, background auto-sync behavior, and the `coraline update` command

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **`--skip-sync` for `coraline embed`** — allows explicitly bypassing the pre-embed sync check when you intentionally want to embed the current indexed state
- **`SyncStatus` preflight API (`extraction::needs_sync`)** — lightweight sync-status check now returns detailed added/modified/removed counts for reuse by CLI and MCP flows

### Changed

- **`coraline embed` now preflights index freshness** — embed checks for stale index state and auto-runs incremental `sync` only when needed, with progress output that reports detected and applied changes
- **`coraline_semantic_search` now performs periodic freshness maintenance** — MCP semantic search throttles freshness checks and, when stale, auto-syncs the graph and refreshes stale/missing node embeddings before serving results

### Documentation

- **CLI, MCP, and README docs updated** — documented `embed --skip-sync`, pre-embed auto-sync behavior, and MCP semantic-search freshness metadata
- **mdBook docs site added** — introduced `docs/book/` and a GitHub Pages deployment workflow (`docs-pages.yml`) to publish documentation on the project GitHub Pages site
- **Architecture docs visual refresh** — replaced ASCII overview with GitHub-native Mermaid diagrams for cleaner rendering and maintenance

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **MCP protocol negotiation and compatibility fallback** — server now negotiates protocol version with clients, preferring `2025-11-25` while retaining compatibility with `2024-11-05`
- **`tools/list` pagination support** — cursor-based pagination added via `cursor` request param and `nextCursor` response field

### Changed

- **MCP lifecycle enforcement tightened** — normal operations now require successful `initialize` followed by `notifications/initialized`
- **Tool error semantics aligned with MCP expectations** — unknown tool calls return protocol errors; tool execution failures continue returning `isError: true` results
- **Tool capability declaration expanded** — MCP initialize response now advertises `tools.listChanged` capability (currently `false`)
- **Core dependencies refreshed for 0.5.0** — upgraded key libraries including `toml` (1.1), `rusqlite` (0.39), `sha2` (0.11), `tokenizers` (0.22), and multiple tree-sitter parser crates; validated with full workspace tests and clippy
- **Workflow supply-chain hardening** — all CI and CodeQL GitHub Actions are now pinned to immutable commit SHAs to improve OSSF Scorecard `Pinned-Dependencies` posture
- **Strict lint command is now standardized** — added tracked `.cargo/config.toml` alias so `cargo lint` consistently enforces the project clippy policy in local and CI runs

### Fixed

- **Tool result schema field casing** — MCP tool results now serialize as `isError` (camelCase) instead of `is_error`
- **Clippy pedantic compliance in MCP server code** — removed no-effect underscore bindings and replaced potential panicking slice/index patterns with safe iterator/object mutation patterns

### Documentation

- **MCP documentation refreshed across README and docs book** — updated protocol/lifecycle notes, pagination behavior, and development examples to reflect current server behavior

## [0.4.4] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **Windows cross-platform CI test failure** — `parse_project_root_accepts_file_uri` unit test now handles Windows file URI format (`file:///C:/...`) correctly by normalizing the leading slash when present; test is now platform-aware and uses appropriate URIs for each platform

## [0.4.3] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **Cross-compilation builds failing on OpenSSL** — switched TLS backend from `native-tls` (OpenSSL) to `rustls` for all HTTP operations; musl and ARM cross-builds no longer require OpenSSL headers or linking
- **Root cause**: `ort` dependency had default features enabled which pulled in `tls-native` → `ureq/native-tls` → `openssl-sys`; now uses `default-features = false` with explicit `tls-rustls`

### Changed

- **`embeddings` feature now uses rustls** — pure Rust TLS for model downloads, no system OpenSSL dependency
- **`embeddings-dynamic` no longer includes any TLS stack** — users supply their own ONNX runtime, no HTTP downloads needed

### Security

- **Pinned all GitHub Actions to commit SHAs** — OSSF Scorecard `PinnedDependenciesID` compliance
- **Added Dependabot configuration** — automated dependency updates for Cargo and GitHub Actions

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **MCP tools discovery without explicit `--path`** — `tools/list` now lazily initializes the tool registry when clients call it before `initialize`, so tools are returned even when `coraline serve --mcp` starts without `-p`
- **Safer MCP project-root URI parsing** — non-`file://` URIs (for example, remote client scheme URIs) are no longer treated as filesystem paths during `initialize`; server falls back to an actual local path when needed
- **Regression coverage for MCP startup flow** — added tests for pre-initialize `tools/list` behavior and URI parsing guards to prevent regressions

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- **Embedding model prompt on `coraline init`** — when stdin is a TTY, `init` now offers to download the embedding model (~137 MB) immediately after initialization; declined or non-interactive runs print a tip and continue normally with full graph functionality
- **`embeddings` is now the default feature** — `cargo install coraline` includes ONNX/semantic search support out of the box; no `--features` flag required for most users

### Fixed

- **MCP server no longer ghost-creates `.coraline/`** — `MemoryManager` previously called `create_dir_all(.coraline/memories/)` eagerly on every MCP startup, leaving a stub directory that blocked `coraline init` from running cleanly; it now returns an error if `.coraline/` doesn't exist, which the MCP tool registry handles gracefully
- **`coraline init -i` on an already-initialized project no longer prompts to overwrite** — when `--index` is present without `--force`, init detects the existing directory, skips the destructive overwrite, and runs indexing directly; use `--force` to explicitly wipe and reinitialize
- **`coraline_semantic_search` MCP tool degrades gracefully without a model** — when no ONNX model file is present the tool is not registered (all other tools remain available) and a warning is emitted to the project log

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **Full multi-language symbol extraction coverage** across all supported languages, including previously missing Python internals and broad AST node-kind mappings.
- **Expanded import/export resolution across languages** for stronger cross-file graph relationships and MCP traversal behavior.
- **Broader call-expression detection and callee extraction** across language grammars to improve call graph completeness.

### Changed

- **Cross-language resolution quality** improved for callers/callees/impact tooling due to richer import/export and call mapping.

### Internal

- Strict lint compliance restored after expansion (`cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings`).
- Release validated with build + full test suite.

---

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **`embeddings-dynamic` feature flag** — alternative to `embeddings` that uses `ort/load-dynamic` instead of `ort/download-binaries`, allowing users on systems with older glibc (e.g., Rocky Linux, HPC nodes) to supply their own `libonnxruntime.so` built against their local glibc ([#8](https://github.com/greysquirr3l/coraline/issues/8))
- **musl static binaries in releases** — `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` targets added to the release CI matrix, producing fully static binaries with zero glibc dependency

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Vector math optimizations** — cosine similarity and L2 normalization now use fused multiply-add for improved numerical stability

### Changed

- **Dependencies updated** — refreshed core dependencies and applied transitive updates for security and compatibility (tree-sitter, clap, tempfile, syn, and 16+ transitive deps)

### Internal

- All tests validated (37/37 passing); property tests ensure numerical accuracy

---

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **`coraline init -i` on an already-initialized project** — instead of hard-failing, the CLI now prompts "Overwrite? [y/N]" when stdin is a TTY, or prints a clear error with `--force` guidance in non-interactive contexts; `--force` / `-f` flag added to `init` to skip the prompt
- **UNIQUE constraint failures on minified/single-line files** — node IDs now incorporate `start_column` in addition to `start_line`, preventing hash collisions for multiple symbols on the same line
- **Garbled progress output during `index`/`sync`** — progress lines now use `\r\x1B[K` (erase-to-end-of-line) instead of bare `\r`, and `stdout` is flushed after each update to prevent interleaving with log output

### Internal

- OSSF Scorecard CI workflow added
- Security audit workflow now also triggers on `deny.toml` changes
- `cargo fmt` style pass across `config.rs` and `resolution/mod.rs`

---

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Release pipeline: binary builds failing on `ort-sys`** — `ort`, `tokenizers`, and `ndarray` are now optional, gated behind an `embeddings` feature flag; default builds no longer require ONNX Runtime prebuilt binaries
- **Release pipeline: `coraline publish` failing when version already on crates.io** — publish steps for both `tree-sitter-blazor` and `coraline` now skip gracefully if the version already exists
- **Release pipeline: build matrix cancelling all jobs on first failure** — added `fail-fast: false` so platform builds run independently
- **Dropped `x86_64-apple-darwin` release binary** — Intel Mac is not a supported target; ONNX Runtime provides no prebuilt binaries for it

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **`coraline init` blocked by log directory** — `logging::init()` eagerly created `.coraline/logs/` before `is_initialized()` ran, making every re-init attempt report "already initialized"
- **`sync` crash on UNIQUE constraint** — incremental sync now catches per-file store errors (warn + continue) instead of aborting the entire sync, consistent with `index_all`
- **`callers`/`callees` CLI showing incorrect results** — CLI was passing no edge-kind filter, surfacing `contains` edges as false callers; now filters to `calls` edges only, consistent with MCP tools
- **CI `actions/checkout@v6`** — updated all workflow steps to the current stable `v4`

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Vector embeddings** — full ONNX pipeline using `ort 2.0.0-rc.11` and nomic-embed-text-v1.5 (384-dim). `coraline embed` CLI command and `coraline_semantic_search` MCP tool
- **25 MCP tools** (26 with embeddings) — complete symbol, graph, file, memory, config, stats, and sync toolset
- **`coraline_stats`** — detailed graph statistics grouped by language, node kind, and edge kind
- **`coraline_dependencies` / `coraline_dependents`** — traversal tools for outgoing/incoming dependencies
- **`coraline_path`** — find shortest paths between any two nodes
- **`coraline_sync`** MCP tool — trigger incremental sync from an MCP client
- **`coraline_semantic_search`** — semantic similarity search over indexed symbols
- **`coraline_find_symbol` / `coraline_get_symbols_overview` / `coraline_node` / `coraline_find_references`** — symbol-level tools matching Serena's precision
- **`coraline_read_file` / `coraline_list_dir` / `coraline_get_file_nodes`** — file exploration tools
- **`coraline_get_config` / `coraline_update_config`** — TOML config management via MCP
- **Memory tools** — `coraline_write_memory`, `coraline_read_memory`, `coraline_list_memories`, `coraline_delete_memory`, `coraline_edit_memory` (regex + literal modes)
- **TOML configuration** — `.coraline/config.toml` with sections for indexing, context, sync, and vectors; written as a commented template on `coraline init`
- **Structured logging** — `tracing` with daily-rotating file appender to `.coraline/logs/coraline.log`; level via `CORALINE_LOG` env var
- **Framework-specific resolvers** — Rust, React, Blazor, Laravel
- **CLI commands** — `callers`, `callees`, `impact`, `config`, `stats`, `embed`; `--json` flag on all query commands
- **Criterion benchmark suite** — 9 benchmarks across indexing, search, graph traversal, and context building groups (`cargo bench --bench indexing`)
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions for multiplatform builds (Linux x86_64/ARM64, macOS x86_64/ARM64, Windows x86_64), crates.io publishing, CodeQL scanning, daily dependency auditing
- **28+ language support** via tree-sitter: Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, TSX, JSX, Python, Go, Java, C, C++, C#, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, Bash, Dart, Elixir, Elm, Erlang, Fortran, Groovy, Haskell, Julia, Lua, Markdown, MATLAB, Nix, Perl, PowerShell, R, Scala, TOML, YAML, Zig, Blazor

### Fixed

- TypeScript import extraction: `import_statement` was wrongly mapped as `import_declaration` in tree-sitter AST
- `import_clause` lookup: switched from `child_by_field_name` (always `None`) to child iteration
- Cross-file import edges test: `SELECT *` placed integer `id` at column 0; changed to explicit `SELECT source, target`
- FTS multi-word search: now uses `OR` logic so partial matches are found
- Glob pattern matching: completely rewritten using `globset` crate; prior regex implementation was non-functional
- Parallel indexing: CPU-bound parse phase separated from sequential DB writes; SQLite PRAGMA tuning (`synchronous=NORMAL`, 64 MB cache, 256 MB mmap)

### Changed

- Database filename: `codegraph.db` → `coraline.db`
- Project directory: `.codegraph/` → `.coraline/`
- Post-commit git hook updated to check `.coraline/` directory
